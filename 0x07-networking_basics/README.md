Networking is a vast field, but here are some basic concepts:

Networks: A network is a group of two or more computer systems linked together. There are many types of computer networks, including local-area networks (LANs), wide-area networks (WANs), metropolitan-area networks (MANs), personal area networks (PANs), and others.

IP Addresses: Every device connected to a network has an IP (Internet Protocol) address. This address is used to identify the device on the network.

Routers and Switches: Routers and switches are devices that manage the traffic between computers on a network.

Protocols: Networks use protocols for communication between devices. The most common protocols include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and others.

Firewalls: A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Wireless Networks: Wireless networking uses radio waves to connect devices to the network. This includes Wi-Fi networks and mobile data networks like 3G, 4G, and 5G. in this project we will be working on LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network) are two types of networks that allow for interconnectivity between computers. Here are some key differences between them:

Coverage: LAN covers a small area such as one site or building (e.g., a home, office, school), while WAN covers large geographic areas (e.g., cities, states, nations)12.

Ownership: LANs are typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization. In contrast, WANs may not be owned by any one organization and often exist under collective or distributed ownership2.

Speed: LANs have a high data transfer rate, while WANs have a lower data transfer rate12.

Cost: Implementing a LAN is generally cheaper than implementing a WAN1.

Fault Tolerance: LANs tend to have fewer problems associated with them, as there are fewer systems to deal with. On the other hand, WANs tend to be less fault tolerant as they consist of a large number of systems2.

Data Transmission Error: LANs experience fewer data transmission errors, while WANs experience more2.

Connection: One LAN can be connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. Computers connected to a WAN are often connected through public networks, such as the telephone system.
