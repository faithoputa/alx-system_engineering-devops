Networking basics typically refer to the fundamental concepts and technologies that form the basis of computer networking. Here are some key points:

1. **Network Devices**: These include switches, routers, and wireless access points. Switches connect devices in a network, allowing them to communicate with each other and share resources. Routers connect multiple networks together and enable all networked computers to share a single Internet connection¹.

2. **Network Types**: Networks can be categorized based on their geographic location and the protocols they use. For example, a Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers in a defined physical space, like an office building. A Wide Area Network (WAN) can connect computers across continents. The internet is the largest example of a WAN².

3. **Protocols**: Networks use protocols to communicate. These are sets of rules that define how data is formatted, addressed, transmitted, received, and acknowledged. Examples of network protocols include HTTP for web traffic, SMTP for email, and FTP for file transfers¹.

4. **IP Address**: Every device on a network has an IP address. This is a unique identifier that allows data to be sent between devices on a network¹.

Remember, this is just a brief overview. Networking is a vast field with many more conccepts and coomponent.
